# data-science-tutorials
A collection of tutorials I've written to explore various techniues for data science.
Currently I'm working on the following:
* Python Visualization - Seaborn + Bokeh + Plotly (to be added)
* Python Distributed computing - How to reduce compute time When working with large datasets,
  specifically will explore pandas integration with dask, ray. Also we'll explore other tricks like 
  parallelizing load operations using multi processing
* Gradient Boosting Algorithms - A powerfule yet less widely known ML tool
* Latent semantic Indexing
